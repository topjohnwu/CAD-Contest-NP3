Given two (in)complete-specified boolean functions, the Boolean Matching problem (under non-exact projective NPNP-equivalence) is to find the assignments to match PIs and POs of one circuit to another and verify whether this assignment is appropriate with functional equivalence checking. The complexity of this problem is $O(2^{m+n}m!n!)$ (m and n is the PI/PO numbers of each circuit respectively). Moreover, we have to consider the situation when the PI and PO numbers of the circuits do not match, resulting in an increase to the difficulty. 

We can directly map the problem to a QBF problem, and thus the complexity is in the extent of PSPACE-complete. To overcome the huge effort to solve PSPACE-complete problems, we have to search for ways to lower the complexity. In the most simplified problem - PP-equivalence, the problem can be solved more efficiently by observing the functional dependency, signature based SAT-solving and pruning [1]; in the latest researches [4,5], they used learning techniques to strengthen the algorithm and improve the speed. These are the keys to solve NP3 Boolean Matching problems with practical time and computing power.

% 給定兩個(in)completelt-specified Boolean function，Boolean Matching 的問題(under Non-exact Projective NPNP-equivalence)是給定PI與PI的對應關係與PO與PO的對應關係後，確認這兩部份的電路在function上是相同的。在問題的複雜度方面，是$O(2^{m+n}m!n!)$，並且需要考慮PI數量與PO數量不相同所會產生的問題，如果使用最直接的觀察，可以將整個問題轉換成一個QBF的問題，即屬於PSPACE-compltete的範圍。關於Boolean Matching 的最簡化版本(under PP-equivalence)，在[1,2,3]中有提到，主要介紹了觀察functional dependency, signature based 並結合SAT-solver以及pruning的方式，而後面比較新的研究[5,6]則是利用learning的機制來加強演算的效率。

% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
