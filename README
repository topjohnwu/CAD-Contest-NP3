Make sure to add executable permissions for the "run" file,
and type './run [0-14] [-v]' to do boolean-matching for case[0-14] in
"bmatch_bench/" directory.
the answer will be print to "match.out" file.
[-v] option is for verification for our solution, only use it in debug mode.
All of our source code are put in the "src/bmatch" directory.

The "run" file is a script, it should handle compilation and commands automatically.
